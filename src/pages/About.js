          <p>My name is Iwana St√§deli and I am a frontend developer student in Hyper Island Sweden who has moved back to Switzerland september 2022 for an internship. I am open for a junior position starting april 2023.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I love to deepen my knowledge in JavaScript and in react or in another JavaScript-framework. In one of my projects I did set up an API with express and MongoDB and since then I can see myself as well wanting to know more about backend.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>With me you will get an openminded, focused and enthusiastic junior, eager to learn more.</p>
